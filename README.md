# 🌕 Render3D Lunar Dataset

*A high-fidelity simulated lunar surface dataset for stereo research*

## 🚀 Overview

Welcome to the **Render3D Lunar Dataset** - your portal to the Moon! This dataset provides high-quality lunar surface imagery, specifically designed for stereo-matching tasks.

Constructed using **Unreal Engine 4**, we've created a realistic lunar simulation environment. Through integration with **AirSim**, we configured autonomous drone flights along planned trajectories to capture multi-view orbital imagery, providing premium input data for your reconstruction algorithms.

## 📊 Dataset Specifications

### 🗺️ Terrain Diversity
- **6 representative lunar terrain types**: 
  - 🌑 Craters
  - 🌊 Maria (Lunar Seas)
  - 🏔️ Highlands
  - 🌑 Rock areas
  - ⛰️ Mountain Ranges
  - + More fascinating landscapes is about to come!

### 📸 Data Contents
| Data Type | Quantity | Description |
|-----------|----------|-------------|
| Monocular Orbit Images | ~500 per terrain | 360° panoramic captures |
| Labeled Stereo Image Pairs | 500+ pairs | Ideal for testing and validation |

## 🎯 Key Features

- **High-Fidelity Visuals**: UE4-powered realistic rendering
- **Multi-View Coverage**: Comprehensive orbital imagery
- **Diverse Terrains**: 6 distinct lunar landscapes
